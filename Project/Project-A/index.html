                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Based on most recent observation, the futuristic-like Flora Strain from the Pedalium Family was first sighted in the Amazon Rainforest by Trisha Ng.
                Once extracted and brought to the lab, scientists noticed that the Flora Strain 9 multiplies in similar conditions to its origin (Amazon Rainforest).
                Prior to further experimentation, not much was known about this species of flower. Basic knowledge on the strain was that its petals excretes a valuable 
                liquid that can be used as a medical treatment for various diseases.  
                
            </p>

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Scientists discovered that once the Flora Strain 9 interacts with their ceramic rod, it takes in another
                form and reacts to magnetic fields. Because each Strain has its own unique appearance, each one also blooms in its own \
                way. Some react positively and some react negatively. No matter what reaction, the petals will eventually excrete the valuable liquid
                in the form of bead drops on the surface of the petal.

                <li>Positive Reaction = gentle movement, vibrant colors</l> 
                <li>Negative Reaction = abrupt motions, dull color</li>
