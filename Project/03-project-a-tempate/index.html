            <p>
                Based on most recent observation, the etherial like Angiospermae was first sighted in the Amazon Rainforest by Trisha Ng.
                Once extracted and brought to the lab, scientists noticed that the Flora Strain 9 multiplies in specifc conditions.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Scientists discovered that once the Flora Strain 9 interacts with their ceramic rod, it takes in another
                form and reacts to magnetic fields. Because each Strain has its own unique appearance, each one also blooms in its own \
                way. Some react positively and some react negatively. 

                <li>Positive Reaction = gentle movement, vibrant colors</l> 
                <li>Negative Reaction = abrupt motions, dull color</li>
